INTRO:
------
"sacrt" can collect and display real-time data from one or more "sac" servers.
It is useful for monitoring telescope data during periods of astronomical 
interest or to check/tweak telescope performance. The program is able to 
connect to multiple servers and rescale the data to compensate for different
volume levels at different sites.


USING SACRT:
-------------
sacrt is a command line driven program which accepts the following arguments:

-s <servername> Connect to the given server, eg "simple.atnf.csiro.au"
                Give multiple -s arguments to connect to multiple servers.
-t <time>       Graph time span in hours, in HH:MM format, "0:30"
-u <seconds>    Update interval in seconds, eg, "10"
-r <seconds>    Rescale the graphs every this many seconds, eg "60"
-o              Scale the power levels to a common value and then offset them
-LST            Show the time axis in server Local Sidereal Time



BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------
In order to build sacrt you should (if you have Linux, the right compiler and
dependent libraries) only need to issue the command...

	make
	
...in the directory containing the sac source code. This produces a binary 
executable called 'sacrt'. Please let me know if you had to alter the Makefile 
or the code to get sac to build on your system. 

Send bug fixes/comments/patches/feature requests to brodrick@fastmail.fm

It is certainly NOT ANSI C++ compliant, for lots of reasons. It might be hard
to build this software using compilers other than gcc and operating systems
other than Linux. You are encouraged to try anyway.

This requires libpgplot5 for rendering the graphs.
